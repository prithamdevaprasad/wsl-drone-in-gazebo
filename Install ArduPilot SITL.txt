Install ArduPilot SITL¶
Ensure that you have an ArduPilot development environment set up, including MAVProxy as a GCS. Verify that you can run SITL examples for Copter and Plane. The ArduPilot Development wiki has all the information required.

Install Gazebo¶
We currently support Gazebo Garden which is available for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) and 22.04 (Jammy) and macOS Big Sur and Monterey.

Install Gazebo following the instructions for your platform.

Check that the Gazebo installation is working:

gz sim -v4 -r shapes.sdf
This should open a world containing a variety of shapes (on macOS you will need to run the Gazebo server and client in separate terminals).

Install the ArduPilot Gazebo Plugin¶
We use a standard version of ArduPilot with a custom plugin for Gazebo which is hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot_gazebo.

Note

While Gazebo is commonly used with ROS / ROS2, the ArduPilot Gazebo plugin does not depend on ROS.

Note

The original version of the plugin located at https://github.com/khancyr/ardupilot_gazebo is compatible with the legacy versions of Gazebo.

Install additional dependencies

Ubuntu

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgz-sim7-dev rapidjson-dev
macOS

brew update
brew install rapidjson
Create a workspace folder and clone the repository

mkdir -p gz_ws/src && cd gz_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot_gazebo
Build the plugin

cd ardupilot_gazebo
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
make -j4
Configure the Gazebo environment¶
Gazebo uses a number of environment variables to locate plugins and models at run time. These may be set in the terminal used to run Gazebo, or set in your .bashrc or .zshrc files:

In a terminal

export GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH=$HOME/gz_ws/src/ardupilot_gazebo/build:$GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH
export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=$HOME/gz_ws/src/ardupilot_gazebo/models:$HOME/gz_ws/src/ardupilot_gazebo/worlds:$GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH
In .bashrc or .zshrc

echo 'export GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH=$HOME/gz_ws/src/ardupilot_gazebo/build:${GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH}' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=$HOME/gz_ws/src/ardupilot_gazebo/models:$HOME/gz_ws/src/ardupilot_gazebo/worlds:${GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH}' >> ~/.bashrc
Using Gazebo with ArduPilot¶
Two models are provided as examples with the plugin: an Iris quadcopter and a Zephyr delta-wing.

Iris quadcopter¶
Run Gazebo

gz sim -v4 -r iris_runway.sdf
Run SITL

sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter -f gazebo-iris --model JSON --map --console
